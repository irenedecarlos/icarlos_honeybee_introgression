#Irene de Carlos #2023 Summer MSc Projec #Simulating Honeybee importation and introgression

#YearlyCicle: this is the yearly cycle of the colonies
#Importation_model: this is the Importation model, it has code that adds the simulation of imports between one honeybee population from Central Europe to a honeybee population in Western Europe to a previous model of the cicle that honeybee colonies go through a year. The scenarios.R code enables to submit different jobs to eddie with
varying percentages of imports and different correlations between traits. 
The simulation.R code is a script that enables to run the different selection scenarios specified in the scenarios.R code and obtain the results in csv files in eddie.
